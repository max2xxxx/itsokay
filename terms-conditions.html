            RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH OUR SOFTWARE USAGE
          </p>
          <p class="text-lg text-white mb-12">
            MoonBot offers software and services that facilitate cryptocurrency
            transactions. However, it is important for users to understand that
            certain risks are inherent in using such technology. By accessing
            and utilizing MoonBot's services, users acknowledge and agree that
            MoonBot cannot be held responsible for any losses, damages, or
            claims arising from events falling under the following categories:
            User mistakes: Users are solely responsible for their actions and
            are expected to exercise caution and diligence when using
            MoonBot-related software and services. MoonBot will not be held
            liable for losses resulting from user mistakes, including forgotten
            passwords, payments sent to incorrect MoonBot addresses, or
            accidental deletion of wallets. Software issues: Despite our efforts
            to provide reliable and secure software and services, technical
            glitches and software problems can occur. MoonBot will not be
            responsible for losses resulting from software issues on the website
            or any MoonBot-related software, such as corrupted wallet files,
            incorrectly executed transactions, vulnerabilities in cryptographic
            libraries, or malware affecting the website or software. Technical
            failures: Users are responsible for maintaining the security and
            integrity of their hardware and storage devices. MoonBot will not be
            liable for losses caused by technical failures in user hardware or
            storage devices, such as data loss due to faulty or damaged devices.
            Security vulnerabilities: While MoonBot takes measures to safeguard
            the security and integrity of its services, security breaches and
            unauthorized access may occur. MoonBot will not be held accountable
            for losses resulting from security vulnerabilities experienced by
            users, such as unauthorized access to wallets or accounts.
            Third-party actions or omissions: MoonBot may rely on third-party
            service providers for certain services, and incidents such as
            bankruptcy, information security breaches, or fraudulent activities
            by third parties can happen. MoonBot will not be liable for losses
            arising from the actions or omissions of third parties or events
            involving third parties. By using MoonBot's services, users
            acknowledge and accept the inherent risks associated with
            cryptocurrency transactions. Users release MoonBot from any
            liability related to such risks.
